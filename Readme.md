## Robot Arm Design and Selection 

In this section, we discuss key considerations for robot arm design and selection. We explore factors such as material, range of motion, and payload capacity. Additionally, we provide insights into the decision-making process and criteria for choosing an appropriate robot arm for tomato harvesting.

### Robot Arm Design Factors

- **Material:** Considerations for selecting materials that ensure durability and efficiency.
- **Range of Motion:** Understanding the required range of motion for effective tomato harvesting.
- **Payload Capacity:** Evaluating the robot arm's ability to handle the weight of harvested tomatoes.

### Selection Criteria

When choosing a robot arm for tomato harvesting, it's essential to take into account...
